# Curtain-project
An arduino project that controls a curtain using a servo motor.
Simply, there are 2 modes to make it work: 1. Manual (Which means you can open and close the curtain by pressing on the button)
                                           2. Auto   (Which means it opens or closes manually by reading a signal from the LDR sensor)
you can switch between the 2 modes using the switch.
